# wikipedia-search

A navigation tool for Wikipedia, allowing history + recommendation links. 

# Grading

I submitted on time so it can be graded now. And Thank you John for the whole semester teaching! 

# Requires

Node
meteor
react

# Usage

Clone the repo, then open the terminal on the folder created and run

```
git clone https://github.com/davidychen/wikipedia-search.git
cd wikipedia-search
meteor npm install
meteor reset
meteor
```

If you don't have Meteor installed
```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

Which will run the front-end development server on the port 3000, then visit (http://localhost:3000) and you should see the app running. The database is running on port 3001.
